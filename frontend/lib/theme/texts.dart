const String aboutMe = """
My name is Victor, I am a student deeply passionate about programming, with a persistent curiosity for how software and systems can solve meaningful problems and improve peopleâ€™s lives. I focus to designing robust architectures,  and scalable services that perform well under real-world constraints. My main focus is AI, where I try my best to build practical, useful tools for everyone. 

Outside of programming, I go to the gym regularly to keep my energy levels up, and I play video games for relaxation. I am adaptable and motivated by building useful, maintainable software that delivers real value.
